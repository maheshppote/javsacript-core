<!-- 
The bind method creates a new function with the same body as the original function but with this permanently set to the provided value.

In the example, this.handleClick.bind(this) ensures that this inside handleClick refers to the instance of the React class.

Summary:
bind is used to explicitly set the this context for a function.

In the example, bind ensures that this inside handleClick refers to the React class instance, allowing access to class properties and methods.

Without bind, this would refer to the DOM element that triggered the event, leading to errors.

An alternative to bind is using an arrow function, which also preserves the correct this context.
